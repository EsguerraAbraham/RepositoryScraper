# RepositoryScraper
This is a test Python script I made that aim to fetch repositories from GoodFirstIssue or UpForGrabs sites.

Use the scrapingrunnermain.py script to use the scraper, then follow the instructions printed on the console.

Feel free to use this and tinker it to your liking! Also, if you find this project helpful, don't forget to star this repository! Thank you!
